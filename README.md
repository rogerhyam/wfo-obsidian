# WFO Pages Plugin

On reflection this never seemed like a good idea! 

The plan was to have a series of species pages maintained in sync with the current classification in the World Flora Online API.
But Obsidian is a text editor and maintaining referential integrity amongst the files as species are added and removed is near impossible - certainly expensive to maintain.
It would be far better just to use a database rather than make a note taking application behave like a db!
